# UCI CCDC Windows Tools (2023-2024)
- These are the Windows tools used by UCI in the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) 2023-2024 season
- As the Windows Lead, I spent a good amount of time working on these tools
- NOTE: I DID NOT WRITE ALL OF THESE TOOLS, but contributed to many
    - PowerSiem_v2 (original by IppSec) developed to actively gather important Sysmon logs
    - NetWatch built to monitor network connections, using regex filters to better understand what is going on
    - BackdoorHound built to use statistical analysis to identify anomalous users in Active Directory
    - Vaccine built to mitigate many Windows vulnerabilities with rapid registry changes
    - Old scripts refined to be more efficient, reliable, and up to date with newer versions of Windows
